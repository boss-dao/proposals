* Online Identity: Roberts1988
* Affiliation: Cardano Proxies
* Role: Boss Dao holder

I am proposing the Boss Dao Invests 5k Ada to sweep as many full sets of Cardano Proxie Nfts as possible, to take advantage of the up and coming wisdom Proxie airdrop
and to further the Dao's exposure into one of the most artistic and creative projects on the chain. For every complete set of 5 Proxies you own, you will recieve a wisdom Proxie airdrop.
The teased art for these Nfts is phenomenal and I anticipate them to be a valuable asset for the Dao. At the current price levels, for 5k Ada I estimate the Dao could acquire at least 6 full sets, 
which would be 30 Proxies and 6 Wisdom proxie airdrops. I also anticipate the value of Wisdom Proxies to be upwards of 200A.

The mission of the Proxie project is extensive, and relates to 5 main areas.
Crypto and Nft Investments 
Social enterprises and humanatarian activities in Africa
Tech and Blockchain development
Art and creativity
Sustainability and conservation

In the aim to keep the proposal brief I wont go into detail about these here, but you can read further in the Proxie website here: https://cardanoproxies.io/


I would assist the Dao in the sweeping to maximise traits, types etc to ensure that the maximum benefit from sweeping would occur. The proxies are currently still holdin abouve their mint price of 
100A with a fp of120A and are developing an extremely creative, artistic and passionate community. I believe the proxies will continue to attract real holders that are investing in the artwork and ethos of the project
and will see a steady appreciation of their value over time. I also believe this could lead to a healthy relationship between the Boss Dao and the Proxies and open the door for talented content creators
to do work for the dao also.
Ideally this vote should happen ASAP as the Wisdom proxie airdrop is currently in it's final stages of preparation.
I think the Dao should hold the assets for at least 1 year, continue to collab with artists from the Proxie community and assess the market situation in 1 years time. But i could see at least a 2x
in a years time on this investment.

I am happy to discuss any questions about this unique project further in discord and I would encourage the reader to look at the Proxies artwork as I believe it is one of the highest quality
art projects on Cardano.

I feel it would be beneficial and prudent for the dao to support up and coming artist in the space and to show the diversity of investment approach that the Boss Dao has.
