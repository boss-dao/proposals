Project: The Seal Society
Position: Moderator

Proposal Summary
I propose that Boss Dao utilize 800 ADA of treasury funds to become a Governor of The Seal Society.  The Governor role consists of one seal from each colony within the society. This role also comes with associated perks that allows an individual to get a free mint and discounts, whitelist with partner networks, and $FISH coin airdrops.
Proposal Details
The 800 ADA treasury allocation would entail purchasing one seal from the following colonies: Sophisticated, Robotics, Agent, Military, 9-5, and Party. As aforementioned, the purchase of these six seals would result in a Governors role within The Seal Society. 
The associated perks for this role are:
•	1 free mint
•	1 white list Tier-A for future seal projects
•	10% discount on future mints
•	Auto-whitelist with partner networks
•	5,000 $FISH quarterly airdrop
•	Official Governor Emblem airdrop

Currently the total purchase amount for six seals from each colony would be approximately 690 ADA, but we increased the amount to account for potential floor changes.  Any unused funds would go back into the treasury.  Current emissions on 10 billion Seal Tokens is on an approximate three to five year emissions schedule.

Staking is scheduled to be released in the next four to six weeks, which should reduce the amount of seals on the secondary market. Each seal that is staked will receive a base reward of 100 $FISH per day. Staking rewards will differ based on the amount of seals, colony, and associated traits. The Seal Society $FISH token will be utilized to purchase digital and physical assets in our Fish Market. We are anticipating the release of the Fish Market shortly before our staking go-live date.  
For a small investment of 800 ADA the benefits outweigh the risks. The Seal Society has a large team of seven individuals, in addition to three moderators. The team has done a great job marketing the project, and this is just the beginning. We can be seen engaging in various twitter spaces, social media posts, and doing interviews with big names on YouTube.  The CNFT space is about community, and building relationships.  I believe this investment will benefit the entire Dao, but most of all set the stage for a strategic partner going forward.
